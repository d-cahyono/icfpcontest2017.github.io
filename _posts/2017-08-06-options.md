Hello punters!

Tony Hoare refers to null pointers as his billion-dollar mistake.
Option types, popularised by functional programming languages, provide a
much cleaner alternative.

This extension has nothing whatsoever to do with null pointers or option types!

New extension: Options
-----------------------

This extension enables _options_, which allow a punter to use a river
claimed by another punter. Every punter is allowed to buy _n_ options
during the game where _n_ is the number of mines. Each river claimed
by a punter has exactly one option which might be bought by a second
punter.

The rules for scoring are unaffected -- but sharing a route with
another punter might be a good option from time to time.

You can find the specification
[here](http://icfpcontest2017.github.io/static/task-options.pdf).

Happy punting, and good luck!
