The _Futures_ are here!

We are releasing the first extension of the contest: Futures.
Futures are bets on reaching a particular site from a mine
and are well rewarded if fulfilled. But beware because failure
can be costly ...


The _Futures_ specification is [here](http://icfpcontest2017.github.io/static/task-futures.pdf).
