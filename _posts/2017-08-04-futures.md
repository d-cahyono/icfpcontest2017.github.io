The _Futures_ are here!

We are releasing the first extension of the contest: Futures.
Futures are bets on reaching a particular site from a mine
and are highly rewarded if fulfilled in the game. But be aware
because failing to achieve your goals is quite costly ...


You can read the specification of the extension [here](http://icfpcontest2017.github.io/static/task-futures.pdf).
