Hello again punters! We hope you are enjoying the contest.

New extension: Splurges
-----------------------

In 1984, Philip Wadler posited that listlessness is better than
laziness. We would like you to help us investigate this claim!

This extension enables _splurges_, which allow a punter to be lazy
(pass!) for _n_ turns, and then claim a list of _n + 1_ contiguous
rivers at once.

The rules for scoring are unaffected --- but being lazy may improve
your chances of building a good route!

You can find the specification
[here](http://icfpcontest2017.github.io/static/task-splurges.pdf).


Lambda Duct v0.3
----------------

Earlier, we also updated Lambda Duct to [version
0.3](http://icfpcontest2017.github.io/static/lamduct-0.3). Lambda Duct
allows you to test your offline mode by relaying your moves to the
game servers.

The major change from v0.2 is that v0.3 uses blocking I/O instead of
non-blocking I/O.

Good luck, and happy punting!
