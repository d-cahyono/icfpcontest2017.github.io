It is time to hop off the punt and go ashore. The contest ended little
over an hour ago. We would like to thank all contestants for punting
with us. We hope you enjoyed punting on the ICFP contest rivers.


## Submission

Please make sure your latest submission is accessible by us,
e.g. visit the Google Drive shareable link in incognito mode.

Quite a few contestants have told us that they forgot to type their
shareable link along with the MD5 checksum into the submission
system. In case you find yourself in this situation then you can still
register your submission via the
[submission system](http://punter.inf.ac.uk:9000/register/). Note: We
only accept this submission if the timestamp on your Google Drive
submission is prior to the official submission deadline.

## Evaluation

We will post further information regarding the evaluation of
submissions in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!
