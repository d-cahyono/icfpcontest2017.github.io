We updated the task description to [version 1.2](https://icfpcontest2017.github.io/static/task-v1.2.pdf).

Biggest change is an update of the protocol to clarify how timeouts are measured.


Changes
----

 – Updated protocol to include handshakes in offline mode and to specify more precisely where
timeouts occur.
 – Clarification on the game outcome when multiple punters score equally.
 – Clarification over the treatment of illegal moves by the server.
 – Clarification over the maximum length of messages.
 – Clarified meaning of disjoint union operator.
