The contest begins in two weeks time. Here is some preliminary
information about the rules.

# Teams

Each participant must be a member of exactly one team. Teams may not
divide or collaborate with one another once the contest has
begun. There is no limit to the number of members of a single team.

# Intellectual property

Contest participants retain ownership of all intellectual property
rights in and to any submitted source codes, custom tools, and related
materials ("Submissions") that participants had before submission. As
a condition of entry, participants grant the judges a non-exclusive,
perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use,
reproduce, publish, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display
the Submissions for the purposes of allowing the judges to test and
evaluate the Submissions for purposes of the contest.
