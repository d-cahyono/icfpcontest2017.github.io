Hello punters!

We hope you're getting on well with punting so far.

We apologise for the initial issues with the web server being
overloaded when the task was announced -- we'd thought that the
university servers would be able to take more punishment! We have now
moved the website over to GitHub so this shouldn't happen again.

There have also been some teething problems with
[PuntFX](http://punter.inf.ed.ac.uk/puntfx), but we are working these
out. These will not affect punters connecting directly to the test
servers.

We will take the servers offline in 15 minutes for maintenance; we
expect downtime to be around 10 minutes.
