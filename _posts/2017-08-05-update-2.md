Hello punters!

We hope you are getting on well.

Due to the webserver glitches at the start of the contest, we are
extending the lightning round deadline by 1 hour. Therefore, the new
deadline will be: [__13:00 UTC__](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20170805T13&p0=1440&msg=Lightning+Round+Deadline&font=sanserif&csz=1)

To submit for the lightning division register [here](http://punter.inf.ed.ac.uk:9000/register/), package your submission into a single `.tar.gz` file with the registration code as file name, upload it to [GoogleDrive](http://drive.google.com), and share the entry with `icfpcontest2017lightning@gmail.com`.
More details in section 7 of the [problem description](https://icfpcontest2017.github.io/static/task-v1.3.pdf).

Good luck!
