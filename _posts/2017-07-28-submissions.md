# VM update

We have uploaded an updated version of the
[VM](http://events.inf.ed.ac.uk/icfpcontest2017/static/vm-readme.md). A
number of other requests have come in and we will upload a further
update early next week.

We recognise that some participants may only realise that they want to
use a particular tool or library once they know what the task is. That
should be fine providing the requested package is reasonably easy to
install on the VM and you include installation instructions along with
your submission.

We will give full details of the submission process along with the
task description next Friday.
