# VM update

We have now uploaded an updated version of the
[VM](http://events.inf.ed.ac.uk/icfpcontest2017/static/vm-readme.md). We
recognise that some participants may only decide that they want to use
a particular tool or library once the contest has begun.

That should be fine providing the package you request is reasonably
easy to install on the VM and you include installation instructions
along with your submission.

# Submissions

FIXME: more details; steal instructions from lambda-lifter spec

We will ask participants to include three components to their
submissions.

  * binary
  * source
  * build/install script

We hope that we can test most submissions just by running the
binary. The build script is only necessary if for some reason that
fails. The source will be used for deciding who wins the judges prize.

We will give full details of the submission process along with the
task description next Friday.
