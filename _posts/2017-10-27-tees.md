Hi Punters! It's been a while.

Following the success of the T-Shirts last year, Shuhei Takahashi has kindly
designed a new ICFP Programming Contest inspired by our Lambda Map!

![t-shirts](/static/tees.png "t-shirts")

None of us profit off these T-Shirts; they are here purely to serve as a
memento.

You can find the design on:
  * [Cafepress](http://www.cafepress.com/cp/customize/product2.aspx?number=146062936)
  * [TMIX](https://tmix.jp/designs/3465031)

You can also print your own T-Shirt if you like, using the PDF
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByBuTZcK8iVlUWhFci1qN1dQaHc). The image
has been released under [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Note that it contains white text, so is unsuitable for inkjet printing. The
design works best on a black T-Shirt. Finally, please do make sure you check the
size chart when choosing the size, as the online retailers to vary!

Thanks Shuhei -- and we hope you enjoy the T-Shirts!
