Welcome to the official website for the ICFP Programming Contest 2017,
the 20th instance of the annual programming contest series sponsored
by [The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional
Programming](http://icfpconference.org/).

This year's contest is brought to you by [LFCS][lfcs] at the
[University of Edinburgh][uoe]. It will be held for 72 hours, starting
from [4th August 2017 12:00
UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20170804T13&p0=304&msg=Start+of+ICFP+Programming+Contest+2017&font=sanserif)
and [7th August 2017 12:00
UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20170807T13&p0=304&msg=End+of+ICFP+Programming+Contest+2017&font=sanserif).

# Task

The task will be published on this website when the contest
starts. Solutions must be submitted online before the contest
ends. Details of the submission procedure will be announced along with
the contest task.

The contest is open to everyone except for contest organisers, their
families, and members of their institutions. Neither advance
registration nor entry fee is required.

# Programming languages

Any programming languages may be used as long as the submitted program
can be run by the judges on a standard Linux environment with external
network access disabled.

# Environment

The judging environment is a virtual machine running a recent version
of Debian with a selection of programming languages installed. It is
available as a Virtual Box image [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bxr4F0XFjDDUdkZod1QyN09TYms).

For further details take a look at the
[readme](http://events.inf.ed.ac.uk/icfpcontest2017/static/vm-readme.md),
which contains instructions and details the default languages and
environments that are installed.

Please let us know before the contest if you would like us to install
anything else.

# Prizes

There will be prizes for the first and second place teams, the team
winning the (24 hour) lightning division, and a discretionary judges'
prize. The winners will be announced at ICFP 2017 in Oxford, UK, on
Tuesday 5th September 2017.

In addition, the organisers will declare during the conference that:

  * the first place team’s language is “the programming language of choice for discriminating hackers”,
  * the second place team’s language is “a fine tool for many applications”,
  * the winning lightning division team’s language is “very suitable for rapid prototyping”, and
  * the team winning the judges’ prize is “an extremely cool bunch of hackers”.
